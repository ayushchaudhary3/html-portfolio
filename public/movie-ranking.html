<h1>The Best Anime According to Ayush</h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>This is my all time favourite anime which gave me all new experience which I never had.</p>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>The One Piece is Real, yes you heard it right, this is all time GOATED anime with good story, characters and life lessons.</p>

<h3>Black Clover</h3>
<p>The story telling peaked here, with a lot of climax and a grind to go to top. Only anime which I can rewatch 10 times.</p>
